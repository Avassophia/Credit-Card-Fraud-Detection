        "# Spam Email Classification\n",
        "This project focuses on spam email classification, a task with strong business relevance since spam filtering protects users from phishing, reduces security risks, and saves productivity. We will implement a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier from scratch to detect spam emails. To validate our implementation, we compare it against scikit-learn’s built-in MultinomialNB. We aim to highlight how the choice between raw counts and weighted features affects a model’s ability to distinguish spam from legitimate messages."

called off dow jones international news finance source world reporter tm ft mccarthy the troubles of enron a texan powerhouse in the energy markets could result in a new financial crisis just last year visitors to enron s glittering headquarters in houston were greeted by a giant banner that proclaimed the firm the world s leading energy company that annoyed enron s smaller energy trading rivals many of which have offices only a stone s throw away in houston s energy alley but not as much as what came next a new banner declaring enron the world s leading company in recent weeks as the company has been engulfed by a financial crisis that banner has quietly been removed the heady mix of audacity ambition and arrogance revealed by the banners is as good a guide as any to enron s remarkable rise and fall forged in the s by the merger of two troubled gas pipeline firms enron drove the development of the sophisticated spot and derivatives markets in energy that it has come to dominate indeed such is the scale of its operations and its dealings with many of the world s financial institutions that some observers see parallels with long term capital management ltcm the hedge fund that failed in and not just because seemingly brilliant financial alchemists have been humbled were enron to go bust unlikely but in the current nervous climate not impossible might a crisis ensue troubles in california s politically crazed power market an ill advised foray into telecoms bandwidth trading and concerns about management badly dented enron s share price earlier this year prompting the departure of jeffrey skilling the firm s newish chief executive in august kenneth lay an avid free marketeer friend of george bush and visionary chairman of the firm was obliged to resume hands on control this has not slowed enron s decline day by day it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial quagmire that is largely of its own creation not least thanks to its lack of transparency the firm s credibility with the markets has eroded to the point that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread enron s reputation for financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its third quarter results came out in mid october showing a billion write off on water distribution broadband trading and other investments worse disclosed only in passing by mr lay in a conference call with analysts the firm suffered a billion reduction in capital stemming from a hedging deal with a related private equity fund called ljm the charge was due to enron s forced sale of m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound this summer almost nobody outside enron had been aware of the terms of the deal with ljm a structured finance vehicle enron s failure to offer details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear the worst about its huge balance sheet its shares plunged by on october th alone see chart on next page before recovering a bit the next day andrew fastow who was replaced as chief financial officer on october th was a general partner in ljm jeffrey mcmahon his successor has much to do to restore confidence questions abound were the trusts run at arm s length what did mr fastow earn from the partnership ominously the securities and exchange commission sec has now launched a formal inquiry moody s a rating agency last week cut its rating on the company s debt to barely above junk level further downgrades might unleash claims from other off balance sheet partnerships those known about such as atlantic water and marlin water do not seem big enough to bankrupt enron but speculation is rife about what other obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles a lower credit rating could destroy enron s core franchise as the leading energy middleman by scaring away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets that might have nasty consequences in other markets enron acknowledges that it is a large participant in the derivatives market holding a portfolio with a notional value of billion rightly or wrongly many traders believe that figure vastly understates enron s presence if the firms on the other side of enron s trades start to fear that payment is not coming they might curb their other trading producing a knock on effect where this could end up is a subject of much conjecture utilities that trade energy could be hit so could the commodity and derivative operations of large commercial and investment banks the ties are notably tight between enron and j p morgan chase according to ventana capital a research firm not only does j p morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for enron it also has the largest derivative operation of any bank as well as a large business trading commodities there is no doubt that enron is on the other side of many j p morgan trades says ventana were enron to fail ventana thinks it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis worse in some ways than what occurred after ltcm that merely froze the debt markets temporarily whereas enron deals in the building blocks of the american economy imagine gridlock in the markets for gas timber coal metals fertiliser bandwidth or indeed any of the products enron deals in as yet this all seems unlikely many big traders were happy to deal with enron this week although at shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past trading on enrononline was reportedly strong jim donnell of duke energy a big energy trader described a huge dichotomy between the collapse in confidence in enron in the equity and credit markets and the business as usual attitude taken by big commodity trading firms when considering enron as a counterparty yet as questions about enron s credit standing spread this week it began to have difficulty making markets in some instruments few firms would accept enron s name as guarantor of a credit derivative in its core energy markets some big trading counterparties refused the enron name on the intercontinental exchange ice two houses reportedly specified that they would not take enron s credit the biggest credit exposure appeared to be with banks whose billion of back up lines to enron were drawn down last week j p morgan arranged an additional billion emergency credit line this week this back up it is widely assumed is needed mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade too big to fail is enron too big and too important to be allowed to fail philip verleger an energy economist thinks that enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced enron s rivals mostly disagree unsurprisingly but even enron s worst enemies do not yet expect the firm to die from its current crisis most traders seem keen that it should live nobody likes to see a wholesale trader disappear says one they admire enron s armies of traders and their ability to do deals enrononline is one of the internet s few success stories assuming its huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits as the firm claims enron s and the financial system s problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to meet its obligations on the surface it is rich in assets if not cash but its lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt in june the economist challenged mr lay to reply to accusations of arrogance high handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law his response was revealing to show that such charges were baseless he pointed to another firm unfairly maligned by critics drexel burnham lambert an investment bank that rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk bond boom of the s drexel was accused of arrogance he groused but it was only being very innovative and very aggressive drexel was not bailed out michael milken its star ended up in jail and drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and ignominy copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved enron gets billion new credit line but must pledge top gas pipeline assets by rebecca smith staff reporter of the wall street journal the wall street journal a copyright c dow jones company inc enron corp secured billion in new credit lines but had to pledge its best gas pipeline assets as collateral the deal did little to appease an important credit rating agency standard poor s ratings group lowered its rating on enron s long term debt by one notch to triple b from triple b plus and short term debt to single a from single a citing a belief that enron s planned sale of assets will be insufficient to restore its long term credit quality to historic levels moody s investors service inc had issued debt downgrades earlier this week s p also lowered ratings on the debt of enron s pipeline systems transwestern pipeline co and northern natural gas co that were used to collateralize a billion bank borrowing from j p morgan chase co and citigroup inc s salomon smith barney unit enron said it would use the money from the day credit lines to refinance roughly million in maturing obligations leaving it million to boost short term liquidity in dropping the pipeline credit ratings by two notches s p noted that the assets have become more strategic to the company in part because they can be relied upon to consistently make money unlike many other enron hard asset investments the pipelines produced million in gas transport revenue and an million pretax profit in the third quarter on generally rising rates that compared with revenue of million for enron s foreign assets that scraped by with a million earnings contribution todd shipman credit analyst for s p said there have been concerns that enron might take on too much debt trying to prove it has enough cash on hand to meet its energy trading obligations but he said s p wasn t worried by the most recent borrowing because we don t think it will be a permanent part of the balance sheet however he added that the amount of additional debt it can take on top of the billion it now has outstanding is little to none with the sharp fall in its stock price enron s market capitalization is now around billion an enron spokesman said it should be a nonissue because the company has no intention of borrowing more money anytime soon in announcing the borrowing plan enron s new chief financial officer jeff mcmahon said it was a move to enhance investor confidence but stock market investors reacted otherwise and enron stock gave up most of wednesday s gain closing at down or in p m new york stock exchange composite trading with many enron bonds trading at two thirds of their par value bondholders didn t seem comforted either enron has been in a defensive posture since it announced a third quarter loss of million two weeks ago followed by news that it also took a billion equity write down based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own officers the company replaced its chief financial officer andrew fastow after the securities and exchange commission began an inquiry into related party transactions enron on wednesday disclosed that the inquiry had been elevated to a formal probe copyright dow jones section c enron s shares fall and debt rating is cut by richard a oppel jr the new york times page column c new york times company dallas nov with investors absorbing news of a formal securities and exchange commission investigation and a downgrading by another large credit rating agency shares of the enron corporation fell percent today giving back most of the gains from wednesday s rally late on wednesday enron the energy trading giant based in houston said the s e c had intensified its inquiry into the company s finances making it a formal investigation carrying subpoena power and today standard poor s lowered its rating on enron s senior debt by one notch leaving it a few notches above junk bond status the downgrading came after a similar cut by moody s investors service on monday s p left enron under review for a possible further downgrading if enron s credit rating were dropped below investment grade it could force the company to issue millions of shares of stock to satisfy debts and prompt other big energy trading concerns to curtail their business with enron s p said that the company s financial flexibility has continued to diminish and that it had been unable to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of enron s core energy marketing business but the rating agency also said it thought that enron s liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty and that so far most counterparties have maintained their trading activity with enron this morning enron said it had obtained billion in additional financing the line of credit may help the company convince investors and trading partners that it can weather this crisis but some industry officials said investors might have reacted negatively because enron had to pledge assets from two subsidiaries northern natural gas and transwestern pipeline to secure the credit line an enron spokeswoman said that she did not know what interest rates the credit lines carried and that the company had no plans to seek even more financing deals enron s shares have fallen by more than half in the last two

securities regulators into enron s accounting and disclosure practices and enron s market value falling by half in the past two weeks many are wondering what impact enron s mounting troubles could

to happen many of enron s energy rivals including dynegy aquila and duke energy are also trading partners or counterparties to enron as such they may be closely tied to enron s fate in the short term the biggest near term threat is if there is another change in enron s credit status this week moody s investors service downgraded enron to two notches above junk status further reductions are for the moment the main worry among its rivals and trading partners although enron debt remains at investment grade levels certainly whenever anybody is downgraded to junk status their counterparties become

trading with it it is often the counterparty of choice since it makes markets in areas where there is not a lot of liquidity enron s trading partners are believed so far not to have changed the terms on their existing contracts with enron however if enron s financial status worsens the lack of confidence could have its own negative impact on the energy trading markets existing market hedges between these multiple firms in the markets could begin to unwind analysts warn which could add to short term instability in the energy marketplace it is unlikely however that energy prices would be

million and the loan component is written off by at least million says convenor of the enron virodhi andolan pradyumna kaul the project will continue to be unviable even after buying it at low cost mr kaul asserts if lng is the fuel the energy price will still be more than rs per unit given the fact that oil will be more than per barrel this will ensure that the unit cost of power will never be less than rs he says at the moment enron is willing to sell power at rs per unit at per cent offtake he points out but this is not possible because a high offtake will not be permitted by the maharashtra electricity regulatory commission in the absence of demand the merc has told the state eletricity board to buy costliest power the last and at a low offtake the plant will be grossly unviable an expert says apart from buying enron s stake at a low cost it is necessary to reduce interest rates from indian fis slash customs duty and sales tax on fuel he says these are some of the demands that dpc has already placed before the govermment even if the plant is sold these factors will hike up the cost he said another alternative is to use the plant for peaking load alone to be used only during a few hours of the day this would bring down costs anti enron activist abhay mehta said in practical terms he said the only player to benefit from a sale is enron corp which is desperately looking to sell its stake such a prospect leaves some grey areas about the future of the judicial inquiry ordered recently by the democratic front government the probe is yet to get under

it is also possible to come to a mutually acceptable settlement before enron exits the country or speed up the actions they say these repercussions are secondary the moot point is a speedy solution to the enron issue says an official mr mehta says the fact that chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already agreed to an extension for the judicial probe beyond six months if it is found necessary

also reduces the amount of cash that enron can raise to back its trading business there are still two levels before those triggers go into effect enron spokeswoman karen denne said the announcement of today s billion loan is the latest step in an orderly plan to strengthen our balance sheet she said denne outlined three steps which include the credit line and a draw down of billion in unsecured credit which was announced last week the final step is billion in asset sales which the company outlined on a conference call last week enron said it expects to close on million in sales before year s end the sales include enron s azurix north america water business to american water works inc for million enron s puerto rican power plant company ecoelectrica holdings ltd to mirant corp and enron s stake in brazilian natural gas distributor cia distribuidora de gas do rio de janeiro to state owned brazilian oil company petroleo brasileiro sa or petrobras the latter two transactions are valued at million each enron spokesman mark palmer said s p said today it doesn t think the asset sales and enron s other plans will be enough to restore enron s credit quality to the bbb level it had since investor confidence the financing is to enhance market and investor confidence enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said in a statement enron can borrow another million by bringing other banks into the loan denne said we don t have any plans to do so at this point she said we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating mcmahon said mcmahon then head of enron s industrial markets group was named cfo last week fastow was ousted in an attempt to restore investor confidence it seems until we know more about the sec investigation it s going to be a difficult time for the stock said tara gately an energy analyst at loomis sayles co which sold most of its enron shares early last year j p morgan is advising enron on the sale of part of azurix salomon smith barney is the investment banking arm of citigroup inc russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom usa enron u s energy trade so far skirts credit woes by joseph silha reuters english news service c reuters limited new york nov reuters enron corp whose shares slumped again on thursday amid investors concerns over a credit crunch has yet to see that fear seriously dent its dealings with other giants of the u s gas and power markets trading volumes in our core wholesale businesses remain extremely strong every day this week volume on enrononline has exceeded our rolling day average we are not seeing people hesitate to do business with us enron spokesman eric thode said enron is by far the nation s largest natural gas and electricity trader with industry analysts estimating it is involved in some percent of daily trade in those markets the company recently became the target of a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships headed by enron s former chief financial officer thode said transactions on the houston based company s widely watched internet enrononline system were averaging some billion to billion a day up from a day average of billion business as usual while enron s dominance of the industry has long been a sore spot with competitors many of its biggest trading partners said it was business as usual despite an percent plunge in the company s share price since january but the drain on the company s capital has not gone unnoticed prompting increased caution among traders but few fears the company will exit the north american energy market enron has come under closer scrutiny but we haven t changed our policy about dealing with the company this is a one time event it s a hurricane but it doesn t mean the weather next year will be bad enron will handle this problem al butkus vice president at utilicorp united said butkus noted enron s problems stem from how the company financed the purchase of some assets not from its trading operations charlotte n c based duke energy another large trading partner also has not curbed its business with enron we have a credit process for our counterparties which tells us how much collateral is required that could come into play if there were further problems with enron s credit but we haven t seen that yet duke energy spokesman terry francisco said traders at reliant energy williams cos dynegy and el paso corp all said they continue to deal with enron but were closely monitoring the situation credit squeeze despite the current calm among energy traders analysts cautioned enron s shrinking capitalization could still squeeze its cash supply and hamper its ability to do business questions about some off balance sheet deals with two partnerships helped pummel the company s stock this week to its lowest level since shrinking market capitalization to less than billion from more than billion in january most of enron s power and gas deals are in the unregulated over the counter otc market so no one outside of the company knows what trades are on their books but enron the biggest market maker in energy products has consistently preached a balanced or hedged book some people may be scaling back their dealings with enron but i think you can rely on enron to do what they should do in risk management practices ed krapels director at massachusetts based energy security analysis inc told reuters i think at the end of the day their book was balanced enough and they should be able to weather the storm but krapels cautioned that further deterioration in enron s share price and credit standing might force the company to post larger cash deposits with its counterparties and ultimately restrict trading operations earlier today merrill lynch lowered its rating on enron s stock to neutral from accumulate enron s shares ended down or percent at copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved india

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we successfully implemented a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier from scratch to detect spam emails. After cleaning and tokenizing the email text, we calculated word probabilities for each class and predicted labels for test messages. To validate our implementation, we compared it against scikit-learn’s MultinomialNB, and achieved equivalent accuracy, precision, and recall, confirming the reliability of our from-scratch model. The project demonstrates the practical significance of spam detection in improving email security as well as enhancing overall user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Further Directions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Experiment with alternative text classification models such as bag-of-words, or TF-IDF, to see if they improve performance.\n",
        "2. Try different classification models not specifically for text classification, such as logisitic regression, random forests, or SVM.  \n",
